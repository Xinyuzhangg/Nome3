# Introductory assignments

Listed below are a few programming tasks that can hopefully get you familier with the Nome 3 codebase.

## Eazy
- [ ] Add torus-knot generator
- [ ] Polish the GUI (adding dark theme or something like that)
- [ ] Allow the user to add primitives using the GUI
- [ ] All the trig functions need to be implemented for the expression parser as well.

## Medium
- [ ] Add a global `$time` variable so that Nome can support simple animation!
- [ ] Support FPS style camera walking (like WASD)
- [ ] Circular reference checking in dependency graph update logic

## Hard
- [ ] Rewrite the 3D engine and port it to Vulkan
- [ ] Parallelize dependency graph update logic
